Knowtation is a full-stack web application inspired by InstantNotation,
a website that allows students to quickly learn guitar with synchronized
music notation and video.

## Features and Implementation

### Knowtation Player

Knowtation is synchronized music notation and video. It is designed to allow
guitar students to have visual and audio assistance in learning music. It
especially benefits guitar teachers, as they don't have to be present for the
student to learn. The Knowtation player works by parsing an array of sync points.
Each sync point has information about the position and time that the Knowtation
player should sync. The Knowtation editor allows teachers to set up these sync
points, as well as preview them before they go live.
